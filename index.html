			<h3>The Pathway to Vocations</h3>

		<h2>What is the problem with vocations?</h2>
		<aside>
			<h4>My Story</h4>
			<p>The Catholic Press has reported a 36% decline in the number of priests in our country since 1981. This shortage of priests hit home recently when our pastor in Houston was ill for over a month and our priest in residence was out of the diocese. We had to seek out any priest that was available to prevent canceling any masses. Some of us were very vocal about the situation and stated we needed to do something about vocations.</p>
			<p>Several weeks later, on a trip to North Dakota, on a tour of Assumption Abbey, I picked up a copy of the Bismarck diocesan paper and read on the front page, “Vocation boom continues in Diocese.” Their ordinations have doubled over the past three decades. Comparing their number of diocesan priests to the Galveston-Houston diocese, they have 10 times more priests per Catholic than we do. But when I compared their number of seminarians per Catholic to ours, I found they have 15 times more than Houston. At that point I decided to expand my research to forty dioceses, and ultimately 50 dioceses. The data continued to show the vast differences between dioceses, including Lincoln having 23 times more seminarians per Catholic than New York. Yes, that is 23 times!</p>
			<p>Why does this imbalance exist? Searching the Internet, I found many opinions but little data for the reasons for priest shortage. I could find no significant studies on the basic reason of vocation shortages or specific action plans to correct the problem.</p>
			<p>After over 100 hours of research, I have come upon some startling information and facts that shows an extremely strong correlation of dioceses with an adequate number of seminarians and those dioceses with a large number of Catholic high schools per Catholic. Likewise, there is an extremely strong correlation of dioceses with an inadequate number of seminarians and dioceses with fewer Catholic high schools per Catholic. Other research data supports the call for more Catholic high schools to increase the number of vocations, but also to teach our youth the values needed to maintain their faith in adulthood.</p>
		</aside>
		<p>We all know that the Catholic Church in the United States is suffering from a vocation shortage. But did you know that the number of priests per Catholic population in a diocese can vary widely, with some diocese producing 13 times as many priests as others? When looking at seminarians, the numbers are even more striking, with the most effective dioceses producing up to 30 times more seminarians than the least effective? In fact, the tiny diocese of Wichita, KS has more seminarians than the large archdioceses of Galveston-Houston, and nearly as many as the massive archdiocese of New York!</p>
		<p>Through my extensive research of fifty dioceses, I have also found a correlation between priestly vocations and affordable Catholic education. Faithful Catholic high schools produce 16 times as many vocations as publicly educated Catholics. And many of these dioceses have even figured out how to make a Catholic education free! Whether a person answers God’s call to a vocation or not no doubt has much to do with the environment they live in. Children can be raised in faithful homes and parishes. But they spend much of their waking hours in schools, homework, and school-sponsored extracurricular activities. It should come as no surprise that the values conveyed through school significantly shapes a child, including whether they even hear – much less answer – God’s call for them.</p>
		<p>My research elaborates on both the variance in vocations and the strategies effective dioceses have employed to make Catholic education both accessible and affordable. I hope you find it informative and motivating.</p>

		<h2>Bishops' Endorsements</h2>
		<p>What bishops from leading vocation producing dioceses have to say:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>“Walt Thome has done a great service to every Bishop, Priest, Seminarian, Catholic parent and young man. His study of trends and correlations between attendance in a Catholic school with increased numbers of seminarians and the resulting increase in ordinations to the Sacred Priesthood is most encouraging and even more helpful. I endorse his good work and I urge all to read what he has found in the light of Our Lord’s command to pray to the Lord of harvest to send laborers to His harvest which is so great. Catholic schools at every level do make a real and positive difference for our good Catholic people.“</p>
			<cite>The Most Reverend David D. Kagan, Bishop of Bismarck</cite>
		</blockquote>
		<blockquote>
			<p>“Mr. Thome has done a great service to the Church with his research document, "Yes We Can: The Pathway to Vocations." While not an exhaustive scientific analysis of the crisis of Catholic education as it relates to the dearth of vocations to the priesthood, Mr. Thome, nonetheless, asks the right questions and his common sense approach to the problems and challenges we face today is quite refreshing. I would recommend his study to anyone who is interested in what's working and what's not working with regard to Catholic education's impact on vocations to the priesthood.“</p>
			<cite>The Most Reverend James D. Conley, S.T.L., Bishop of Lincoln</cite>
		</blockquote>
		<blockquote>
			<p>“I am grateful to learn of your research regarding the vocation crisis in the United States. As you know, the Diocese of Wichita is uniquely blessed with a large number of seminarians and now recently with several large classes of ordinations, twenty in two years. We are blessed with a mass attendance of slightly more than 50%, which is almost double the national average. These are just some of the aspects of this diocese which is experiencing now a great energy in regard to priestly vocations. To put it in another way, we are BLESSED! With these thoughts in mind, I endorse your book YES WE CAN as it gives a much needed perspective in order to bring about the priestly vocations necessary to meet the challenges of the New Evangelization in the 21st century. God bless you.“</p>
			<cite>The Most Reverend Carl A. Kemme, Bishop of Wichita</cite>
		</blockquote>
		<blockquote>
			<p>“Yes We Can gives hope to the shortage of priests because there seems to be a solution to the shrinking number of priests. It will take a lot of work for the goals of YES WE CAN to come true, but there is always hope with God’s love and faithful Catholics like Mr. Thome searching for answers.”</p>
			<cite>Fr. T.J. Dolce, Director of Vocations Office, Archdiocese of Galveston-Houston</cite>
