			<h3>The Pathway to Vocations</h3>
		</header>
		<h2>What is the problem with vocations?</h2>
		<p><b>The Catholic Press has reported a 36% decline in the number of priests in our country since 1981.</b>This shortage of priests hit home recently when our pastor in Houston was ill for over a month and our priest in residence was out of the diocese. We had to seek out any priest that was available to prevent canceling any masses. Some of us were very vocal about the situation and stated we needed to do something about vocations.</p>
		<p>Several weeks later, on a trip to North Dakota, on a tour of Assumption Abbey, I picked up a copy of the Bismarck diocesan paper and read on the front page, “Vocation boom continues in Diocese.” <b>Their ordinations have doubled over the past three decades.</b> Comparing their number of diocesan priests to the Galveston-Houston diocese, they have 10 times more priests per Catholic than we do. But when I compared their number of seminarians per Catholic to ours, I found they have 15 times more than Houston. At that point I determined there was a need to expand the data to forty dioceses. The data continued to show the vast differences between dioceses, including Lincoln having 23 times more seminarians per Catholic than New York. Yes, that is <b>23 times!</b></p>
		<h2>Why does this imbalance exist?</h2>
		<aside>Searching the Internet, I found many opinions but little data for the reasons for priest shortage. I could find no significant studies on the basic reason of vocation shortages or specific action plans to correct the problem.</aside>
		<p>After over 100 hours of research, I have come upon some startling information and facts that shows an extremely strong correlation of dioceses with an adequate number of seminarians and those dioceses with <b>a large number of Catholic high schools</b> per Catholic. Likewise, there is an extremely strong correlation of dioceses with an inadequate number of seminarians and dioceses with fewer Catholic high schools per Catholic. Other research data supports the call for more Catholic high schools to increase the number of vocations, but also to teach our youth the values needed to maintain their faith in adulthood.</p>
		<p>My 35 minute PowerPoint presentation gives action plans to accomplish the needed objectives. The name of my presentation is <b>YES WE CAN</b>.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>YES</b>: Saying yes to the will of the Father. He alone is in control.</li>
			<li><b>WE</b>: We work together in the name of Jesus for team goals. Jesus is our Captain.</li>
			<li><b>CAN</b>: Keeping a positive attitude and accept the guidance of the Holy Spirit.</li>
		</ul>
